Hi! My name is Arif Widi Nugroho. I love doing software development with all kind of tech (frontend, backend, deployment and a bit of maintenance). I'm probably fallen into that category called "Full Stack" developer.

I do consulting for general software development (desktop and server app), web development, and occasional mobile app development. I'm based in Bandung (Indonesia) and available remotely. Ping me at [arif@sainsmograf.com](mailto:arif@sainsmograf.com), I'd love to chat sometimes :).

Computing device has always trigger my curiosity since I was young. When I was a kid, I used to wonder how they made those NES games. I knew I would work on software development.

Why do I find software development so interesting? It's like writing novel, except you can actually see your creation comes alive, doing things and interact with people based on carefully crafted logic poured into its programming. 

Later in high school, I've become interested in biology. Why? I think I found that biology shares some aspect with software development. For example, a complex, well-engineered software is an analogue to a cell. All the tiny details, from how the genes encoded into dna, how the enzimes interact with each other to perform a complex task, energy extraction, waste regulation, all those mechanisms fit in together nicely to form a living cell. A cell is a tiny, sophisticated piece of machinery engineered to perfection.

Exploring Biology is a lot of fun, but high school biology is no fun at all. All the interesting part is removed to make the curriculum reasonable, which is sadly make it uninteresting to many students. When the term exam comes, everybody shiver on the face of terrifying combo of biology and math tests.

Fortunately, I found a lot of fun by participating in the national science olympiad, on the biology field. The competition looks like a grind to many, but through it I was able to continue exploring biology and met with many wonderful people who share the same view and passion. I made it to the national level and obtain a gold medal, and eventually I got a bronze medal in the international biology olympiad 2006. Around that time, I was unsure about what education path I should take afterward, and eventually fallen into engineering path. In retrospect, being an engineer is what I aspire for. Something I didn't realize in high school.

Like any other engineering fields, software development is a craft. Your knowledge compounds over time. Things that don't make sense eventually become obvious as you grow. The knowledge that accumulated over time is the basis of innovation in the field of software development.

Unlike other engineering fields, software development is still relatively young. Just when everything started to get boring, another break through comes in. While some of the break troughs are actually repeat of the old tricks immediately recognized by the wise, aged veteran of the industry, exploring them can stimulate one's intellectual curiosity, giving more insight and raising more ideas which become the fuels for future innovations.

Even today, there are many fields that haven't fully leverage the latest of technology and can benefit immensely from it. Closing the technological gap is what a software engineer should strive for.
